Simpson is a function that uses the Composite Simpson's 1/3 Rule to integrate specific inputed values. If the number of inputed values is
even, meaning the number of segments is odd, the last segment will be intgrated using the Trapezoid rule.

Inputs:
  x = row vector of independant variables
  y = row vector of dependant variables
Outputs:
  I = Total integral
